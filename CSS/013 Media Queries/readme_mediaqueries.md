# Responsive Web Design with Media Queries

When building responsive websites, media queries are one of the most powerful tools youâ€™ll use. They let you apply different styles depending on the size (or type) of the device displaying your site.

## What is a Media Query?

A media query checks the size of the screen (or other device features) and applies CSS styles if certain conditions are met.

The syntax looks like this:

```CSS
/* CSS */
@media (condition) {
  /* CSS styles go here */
}

```

## Breakpoints

A breakpoint is the point where your layout changes to fit the screen better.
For example, you might want your text to shrink when viewed on a phone.

```CSS
/* CSS */
/* Default (desktop styles) */
h1 {
  font-size: 48px;
}

/* Apply new styles for screens 600px wide or less */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}
```

On a desktop, the heading is big. On a phone, itâ€™s smaller.

## Max-width vs Min-width

There are two main keywords youâ€™ll see:

- max-width â†’ Styles apply when the screen is up to this size (smaller screens).

- min-width â†’ Styles apply when the screen is at least this size (larger screens).

Example:

```CSS
/* CSS */
/* Smaller screens (â‰¤ 600px) */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background: lightcoral;
  }
}

/* Larger screens (â‰¥ 601px) */
@media (min-width: 601px) {
  body {
    background: lightgreen;
  }
}
```

## Combining Breakpoints

You can target a range of screen sizes by combining min-width and max-width with and.

```CSS
/* CSS */
/* Between 600px and 900px */
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 900px) {
  body {
    background: lightblue;
  }
}

```
Here is a breakdown of what each part means for a beginner:

- @media: This keyword signals the start of a media query. It tells the browser, "only apply the following CSS rules if the conditions I'm about to specify are met."

- (min-width: 600px): This is the first condition. It translates to "if the screen's width is at least 600 pixels." It sets a minimum size for the style to be applied. 

- and: The "and" means both the min-width and max-width conditions must be true for the CSS to be applied.

- (max-width: 900px): This is the second condition. It means "if the screen's width is at most 900 pixels." This sets a maximum size.

## Media Types (screen vs print)

By default, media queries apply to screens. But you can also target print:

```CSS
/* CSS */
/* Screen styles */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background: lightgoldenrodyellow;
  }
}

/* Print styles */
@media print {
  body {
    font-size: 12pt;
    color: black;
    background: white;
  }
}
```
This way, your website looks printer-friendly when someone prints the page.

## Common Breakpoints (Device Categories)

Here are some typical screen-width ranges:

- Mobile phones â†’ 319px â€“ 480px

- Tablets / iPads â†’ 481px â€“ 1200px

- Laptops â†’ 1201px â€“ 1600px

- Desktops / Large screens â†’ 1601px and up

Example:

```CSS
/* CSS */
/* Mobile */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body { background: salmon; }
}

/* Tablets */
@media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
  body { background: powderblue; }
}

/* Laptops */
@media (min-width: 1201px) and (max-width: 1600px) {
  body { background: limegreen; }
}

/* Desktops */
@media (min-width: 1601px) {
  body { background: seagreen; }
}
```


## How to Test Responsiveness

- Resize your browser window manually to see changes.
- Use Chrome Developer Tools:
- Right-click â†’ Inspect â†’ Toggle device toolbar (ðŸ“± icon).
- Choose devices like iPhone SE, iPad Air, etc.
- Or set custom screen sizes.


## Exercise

- Open your index.html.
- Set a default background color.
- Write four media queries (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop).
- Change the background color for each screen size.

When you test, your page should display different colors depending on the screen width.


## Key Takeaways

- Media queries make your website responsive.
- Use max-width for smaller screens and min-width for larger ones.
- You can combine breakpoints for precise ranges.
- Media queries work for more than just size (e.g., orientation or print).
- Always test your site across devices.
